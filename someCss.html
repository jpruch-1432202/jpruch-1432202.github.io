Here is a paragraph with font 1. Look at how cool it is!
  I could keep typing in this font, or I could type in another font.
  I'll try another font later. I like this one.

<h4>Font #2</h4>
<p>
<p style = "font-family: Courier New;">
Here's a second font. I think I like this one even more than the first.
Pretty cool that you can use CSS to change the styling. It's the
technical verison of selecting an option on word!
